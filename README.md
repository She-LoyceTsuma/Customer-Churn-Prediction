## About Sunborn

Sunborn is a family business group with a legacy spanning five decades, primarily focused on yacht hospitality. 

They engage in innovative maritime construction and development, manage healthcare assets, and own real estate across diverse sectors.

As competition intensifies and market saturation increases, customer retention has become essential, as acquiring new customers is significantly more costly. 

Research indicates that retaining existing customers can lead to substantial profit increases, highlighting the importance of investing in effective customer retention strategies.

The task is to predict whether a customer will continue living in their rental yatch or vacate (i.e., churn). This model could be critical for luxury real estate and maritime hospitality developers to understand customer behavior and implement retention strategies

The project aims to:

- Identify key features influencing customer churn.

- Develop an accurate predictive model for churn classification.

- Recommend strategies for customer retention.

Key research questions include :

- Identifying significant predictors of churn

- The accuracy of predictions

- Investigate the relationship between service features and customer retention strategies.

By focusing on these areas, the project seeks to help Sunborn effectively mitigate customer churn and enhance overall business performance.
